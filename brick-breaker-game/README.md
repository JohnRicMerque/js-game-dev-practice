### What I learned
This was my first tutorial and I learned a lot from setting up canvas environment to complicated maths and algorithms to make complicated things possible. This tutorial implemented many JS scripts, which utilizes object oriented programming. It used different classes for each element, which essentially has given me an idea how independently coordinated elements are in building games like this.
