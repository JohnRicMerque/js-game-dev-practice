The project of the 7th video tutorial of JavaScript Game Development Masterclass 2022 by Franks Laboratory.
A complete point and shoot game with randomized target size and speed, explosions, trails, scoring and game over functionality. I followed this for educational purposes only.

## What I learned
Incorporating delta time to unify speed accross devices with different processing speed. Familiarizing with and setting classes and class methods and properties to construct an element in the game and make it interact with other elements. Using arrays to house class instances, and push and filter method to add and delete them to the canvas. Using sprite animation and event-triggered animation. Over-all algorithm and logic in game development and vanilla JavaScript.
