# NPC Variety
The project of the 8th video tutorial of JavaScript Game Development Masterclass 2022 by Franks Laboratory.
A mixture of different enemy classes using subclassing, inheritance and sprite animation. I followed this for educational purposes only.

## What I learned
This tutorial enhanced its code structure compared to the previous videos. It used a document listener encapsulating the whole code to only run upon load. It also used a game class which avoids code repetition since you'll only have to run methods once in the animation loop. This also helped me understand delta time a bit deeper, and how it works to unify game speed. Using subclassing and inhertance is also utilized which gives much concise code since methods are being inherited from a parent class, and unique methods for children classes are only added, which essentially avoids code repetition. Also I've learned that you can use images and sprite sheets instantiated from the html DOM and there's no need for a selector, or creating a new image object method to add sprites. Overall the code style structure was improved but is still parallel from the previous which makes it easier to understand and absorb as i go through this course. I learned a lot from this tutorial both in Vanilla Javascript logic and game development especially in creating variety of NPCs.
